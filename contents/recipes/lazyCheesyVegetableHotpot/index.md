## Ingredients ##

* 3 leeks, trimmed, washed and roughly sliced
* large knob butter
* ½ small Savoy cabbage, shredded

1.    In a shallow microwavable dish toss the leeks in half the butter and cook on High for 5 mins until they begin to soften. 
1. Stir in the cabbage and mushrooms and add the crème fraîche. 
1. Lay the potato slices over the vegetables pressing them down with a fish slice.
1.    Dot the potatoes with the remaining butter and microwave, uncovered, for 15-20 mins on High until they are done.
